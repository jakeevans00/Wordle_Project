# Wordle_Project

Wordle is a popular game developed by Josh Wardle - this project is a clone from scratch 

### Milestone 1: Pick a random word and display it in the first row of boxes

For your first milestone, all you have to do is choose a random word from the list provided in the
WordleDictionary.py module and then have that word appear in the five boxes across the first row of
the window. This milestone requires only a few lines of code, but requires you to understand
what tools you have and start putting them to use

### Milestone 2: Check whether the letters entered by the user form a word

For Milestone #2, your job is to write a version of enter_action that checks to see whether the
string it has been given is a legitimate English word. If it isnâ€™t, your implementation of enter_action
should call the show_message method with the string "Not in word list", which is what the Times
website says. If it is a word, you should display some more positive message that shows that you
got this milestone running.

### Milestone 3: Color the boxes

For this milestone, you need to add code to enter_action that, after checking to make sure it is a
legal word, goes through and colors the boxes to show the user which letters in the guess match
the word.
